A program made using python which upon execution changes all files of the 
desired location (within the code) to text files with useless info.

The files replaced can not be recovered at any cost, they are permanently 
removed from the system.

The files being affected by the program right now =>
1) .cpp 
2) .pdf
3) .txt

More files can be added easily in this list.

Good understanding of python lybraries like 'os' is must.


THANK YOU !
